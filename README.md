# NoteTask


I always have an idea for tasks I would like to do later such as grocery shopping or a coding 
project. I usually enter the ideas or whatever I need into a notetaking app, but it get’s messy 
with the other notes I have which do not have any subtasks. 
My project’s name is ‘NoteTask’. Basically This app will consist of three features. The first one is 
the main one and that is the notepad. But this has two integrated components. The second is 
the tasks feature with a reminder function. You can easily add tasks within the notepad. The 
third feature would be the calendar. You can see all your notes and tasks in the calendar.
